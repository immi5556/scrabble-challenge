The challenge is about famous word game Scrabble. We are providing the final state of the game board in file `board.json`, your aim is to write a program that computes the final scores for each player and find who won the round.

- Given data represents the final state of the game (`board.json`)
- Each entry represents a letter on the board with coordinates and which player placed or re-used the letter to form a word (a letter can be used by multiple words)
- First element is ```Y``` cordinate, second element is ```X``` coordinate, third element is the letter itself, fourth element is the list of players used the letter 
- All words on the board considered to be valid
- The words are at least 2 letters long
- The board dimensions are 15 x 15
- There are no letter or word multipliers on the board
- Second dataset represents the points for each letters in the alphabet. (`letters.json`)

While doing that;
- Consider coding guidelines documents
- Programming language does not matter however we want the solution to be in an OOP approach, C#, PHP, Javascript, Typescript, Java, C, Python, Go etc. should work
- Consider dockerizing your solution so it would be easy to test
- Consider that there can be edge cases that can not be solved

From our perspective;
- We haven't implemented a solution to this challenge
- There might be cases where you can not come up with an absolute solution
- We want to review how you approach the problem and how you reflect it to the code
- We expect you to discuss any edge cases that you found out during implementation and analysis
- Don't spend more than 6-7 hours in total
